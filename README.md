# About:

From scratch implementations of **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** (diminsionality reduction) and **K-Means** (clasification) unsupervised learning algorithms in python, using human face images from https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/11785-spring2021-hw2p2s1-face-classification/data


# Visualizing the clusters:
After reducing the dataset's dimension to 2 for the sake of visualization using PCA, we have the following results:
